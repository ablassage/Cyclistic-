# Cyclistic Case Study - 
For the Google Data Analytics Capstone I chose the Cyclistic project.  The purpose of the analysis was to figure out the difference between casual riders and members and how to help the marketing team entice the casual riders to become members, as membership is more profitable for the Cyclistic team.  I utilized a few tools during this analysis, the ones I used were Excel, R, and Tableau, with most of the analysis happening in R.
